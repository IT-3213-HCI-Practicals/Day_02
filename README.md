# Axure Calculator Prototype

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **calculator prototype** designed using **Axure** as part of an **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** project. Currently, it **only supports number input**, and other function buttons are not yet interactive.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Supports number input (0-9)
- ❌ Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) **not yet functional**
- ❌ UI interactions for equal (`=`), clear (`C`), and other operations **not implemented yet**

## 📂 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axure-calculator.git
2. Open the Axure file (.rp file) in Axure RP.

3. Click Preview in Axure to test the prototype.

🔧 **Future Improvements**
-  Implement functional arithmetic operations.

- Improve UI interactions for buttons.

-  Add error handling for invalid inputs.
